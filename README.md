```

## Creating Website
1. Install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/), this theme requires the "extended version" (or installed Dart Sass) because it uses SCSS.
2. Follow the Hugo [quickstart](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/):
    1. Test if Hugo is correctly installed.
    ```sh
    $ hugo version
    ```
    2. Create new Hugo website structure
    ```sh
    $ hugo new site [project name]
    ```
3. Add this theme as submodule in the `themes` folder:
```sh
$ cd [project name]/themes
$ git submodule add [this repo url]
```
- (Optional) Freeze submodule to specific release (tag):
```sh
$ cd [project name]/themes/hugo-theme-ncsu
$ git checkout v2024.08rc
```
5. Copy example config file to website (from the theme's folder):
```sh
$ cp [project name]/themes/hugo-theme-ncsu/hugo.toml [project name]
```
6. Edit `hugo.toml` config file to set website titles etc. (see documentation for settings).
```sh
$ nvim [project name]/hugo.toml
```

## Deploying Website
Two ways:
1. Using GitHub / Gitlab /... actions to deploy directly to web server.
   - GitHub pages supports Hugo
   - Alternative (free for static websites) services: Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare
3. Use hugo (just the CLI command `hugo` in the project folder) to generate a `public` folder with all the necessary HTML and resources to directly deploy to a web server
    - Might require to set `baseURL` variable in `hugo.toml` to web servers base url for resources to be loaded correctly.

## Releases
- The main branch receives continous updates and features (although likely at a slow and non-breaking rate because static website theme).
- Frozen releases are tagged and released with the name of upcoming semesters, e.g., `2024.08` for Fall semester 2024, you can set specific releases in the submodule to freeze the theme version.
